# def extra_notes():
    # Advanced Recommendation System Requirements:
    # 1. Collaborative Filtering

    # Find users with similar listening patterns
    # Recommend songs liked by similar users
    # Weight recommendations by user similarity score

    # 2. Content-Based Filtering

    # Recommend songs similar to user's liked songs
    # Use Song.is_similar_to() method
    # Factor in audio features, genres, artists

    # 3. Hybrid Approach

    # Combine collaborative and content-based recommendations
    # Add diversity to avoid echo chambers
    # Include trending/new releases in mix

    # Complex Features to Implement:
    # 1. Smart Playlist Generation

    # generate_workout_playlist(user, duration_minutes) - high energy songs
    # generate_chill_playlist(user) - calm/ambient music
    # generate_discovery_playlist(user) - 50% familiar, 50% new music

    # 2. Advanced Analytics

    # Track listening patterns by time of day, day of week
    # Identify user "listening sessions" (continuous play periods)
    # Calculate user engagement metrics

    # 3. Social Features

    # Users can follow each other and see friends' activity
    # Share playlists and see what friends are listening to
    # Collaborative playlist creation

    # 4. Business Logic

    # Free users: ads every 3-5 songs, skip limits, lower audio quality
    # Premium users: unlimited skips, offline downloads, high quality
    # Artist payment calculations based on play counts and user subscription types

    # Bonus Challenges:

    # Mood Detection: Analyze listening patterns to detect user mood and suggest appropriate music
    # Concert Recommendations: Suggest upcoming concerts based on listening history and location
    # Social Listening: "Listen along" feature where friends can listen to same song simultaneously
    # AI DJ: Create an AI that can smoothly transition between songs like a radio DJ
    # Lyrics Integration: Add lyrics to songs and implement lyric search functionality

    # Algorithm Challenges:

    # Implement efficient similarity calculations for large music libraries
    # Design recommendation algorithms that balance accuracy with diversity
    # Create playlist generation algorithms that consider song flow and transitions
    # Build efficient search with fuzzy matching for typos

    # Start with the core classes, then implement basic recommendation logic. The recommendation engine is the most complex part - you'll need to think carefully about how to measure user similarity and song similarity!
